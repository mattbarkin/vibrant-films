We recently re-watched out series and it sure does hold up!\
\
Don’t Call it Frisco was released 8 years ago. It's a web series that takes a stab at spoofing San Francisco. Unlike Portlandia it’s story based so it’s closer to Silicon Valley. It’s main character Pat moves here to start a new life with his girlfriend but everything goes to shit. Sound familiar?

Check it out if you haven't seen it! If you don't laugh we'll give your money back.
