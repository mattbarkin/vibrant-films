slide1: “Within a week of launching our crowd-funding campaign, we reached 500K
  video views, landed in major tech blogs and reached our funding goal. The
  pitch video is the key element of any funding campaign and we attribute much
  of our success to the quality of the video that Vibrant delivered. The Vibrant
  team is professional, passionate and were involved throughout the process.
  They helped us storyboard our ideas and provided great guidance and direction
  during the video shoot. Finally their attention to small details in
  post-production really allowed our product to shine.”<small>Yashar Behzadi-
  Co-Founder of Popslate</small>
slide2: " “We’ve used Vibrant Films to record our annual Blessing of the Grapes,
  grape stomping at the winery and Miljenko “Mike” Grgich addressing the crowd
  and we loved the results. We found them easy to work with and able to quickly
  edit and turn around projects, all under budget. Thanks guys!”<small>Ken Moris

slide3: " “Sam Sarraf is a visual genius. He was able to capture every element
  of my concepts in vibrant and relevant color. His artwork is timeless. I would
  highly recommend him to anyone.”<small>Jay Erickson – CEO of
  MyCityLender</small>"
slide4: " “Adam Ducharme will never let you down. Not only is he a relentless
  worker, he is always striving to deliver a better creation. He treats all his
  work as if it was his own and he’s always looking for the best solution to
  suit your needs and to take it beyond what you imagined. He was trained by the
  best in the business and therefore knows how to combine creativity, work
  ethic, and professionalism. And last but not least, he is a pleasure to work
  with.”<small>Melissa Baldino – Executive Producer at America’s Test
  Kitchen</small>"
slide5: " “We were extremely lucky to have Vibrant Films produce the promotional
  video for us. When we first got in contact, the Thought Market was still only
  an idea given some serious discussion and it changed almost daily. But Matt
  and Adam were able to take what was little more than a vague story and script
  and turn it into a powerful video that represents the business in an inspiring
  manner.”<small>Benjamin Burger – Founder of Thought Market</small>"
slide6: " “We have worked with Vibrant Films to produce a video for our
  fundraising events for the past two years. There are no words to describe how
  easy they are to work with and how professional and creative their entire team
  is. Along with how much we enjoy working with them – their work is top notch!
  Our last two events raised a record amount of money for our organization and I
  wholeheartedly believe that is due to the amazing video they produced. They
  told our clients stories in a humanizing and compassionate way. I am looking
  forward to producing our next video with them!”<small>Michelle Hudson – VP of
  Development at Walden House</small>"
