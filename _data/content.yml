slide1: “Within a week of launching our crowd-funding campaign, we reached 500K
  video views, landed in major tech blogs and reached our funding goal. The
  pitch video is the key element of any funding campaign and we attribute much
  of our success to the quality of the video that Vibrant delivered. The Vibrant
  team is professional, passionate and were involved throughout the
  process.”<small>Yashar Behzadi- Co-Founder of Popslate</small>
slide2: " “We’ve used Vibrant Films to record our annual Blessing of the Grapes,
  grape stomping at the winery and Miljenko “Mike” Grgich addressing the crowd
  and we loved the results. We found them easy to work with and able to quickly
  edit and turn around projects, all under budget. Thanks guys!”<small>Ken Moris

slide3: "\"It's great when I get a call from Vibrant Films, I always enjoy
  collaborating with Matt and the guys over there. He really understands what it
  takes to get a job done in the Bay Area - he's reliable, flexible, and
  diligently thorough on every project. Couldn't recommend Vibrant Films more
  highly.\"<small>Danielle Cheifetz</small>"
slide4: '"As a UX designer I have had plenty of trouble dealing with video
  production companies that tend to focus on getting the video out that
  satisfies the brief and not working with me on developing my ideas. Vibrant
  Films have changed my mind about how a production company works with me on
  creating something that comes out better through inventive ideas. It doesn’t
  hurt that on the shoots Matt is a benevolent dictator and keeps spirits up
  high on long days." <small>Eric Higashino - UX Designer</small>'
slide5: " “We were extremely lucky to have Vibrant Films produce the promotional
  video for us. When we first got in contact, the Thought Market was still only
  an idea given some serious discussion and it changed almost daily. But Matt
  and Adam were able to take what was little more than a vague story and script
  and turn it into a powerful video that represents the business in an inspiring
  manner.”<small>Benjamin Burger – Founder of Thought Market</small>"
slide6: " “We have worked with Vibrant Films to produce a video for our
  fundraising events for the past two years. There are no words to describe how
  easy they are to work with and how professional and creative their entire team
  is. Along with how much we enjoy working with them – their work is top notch!
  Our last two events raised a record amount of money for our organization and I
  wholeheartedly believe that is due to the amazing video they produced. They
  told our clients stories in a humanizing and compassionate way. I am looking
  forward to producing our next video with them!”<small>Michelle Hudson – VP of
  Development at Walden House</small>"
